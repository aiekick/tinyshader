Builtin functions:

Preprocessor:
    #error
    #if
    #elif
    function-like #define

Vulkan-specifics:
    push constants
    combined image sampler
    specialization constants

Language features:
    vector casting: float2(uint2(1, 2))

    parse register decorations

    support struct entry point parameters
    support entry point return values & decorations

    .GetDimensions on StructuredBuffers
    .Load on StructuredBuffers

    static variables

    struct literals
    arrays
    typedefs
    TextureBuffer
    texture arrays
    arrays of textures

Low priority:
    1-dimentional vector types
    column_major/row_major matrices
    cbuffer
    tbuffer

Internals:
    some dead code elimination
